Here is a transcription of a podcast with timestamps.

Your goal is to find up to 3 highlight segments between 5 and 20 seconds each that are particularly compelling, emotional, funny, insightful, or intense.

Expected output: a 2D array of start and end timestamps.

- For each highlight, use the "start" of the first segment and the "end" of the last segment.
- If no suitable highlights are found, respond with [] (an empty array).

Output format: Array<[number, number]>
Example: [[12.034, 25.982], [142.532, 159.242]]
Only return the array. No explanation.

Here’s the transcript:
