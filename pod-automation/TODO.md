## Why Use `llama.cpp` (Instead of Ollama or Similar Wrappers)

### 🧠 Full Control

- Run any `.gguf` model locally without restrictions or wrappers.
- Choose quantization levels, context size, threading, and runtime options.

### 📦 No Vendor Lock-In

- Ollama and others often use internal formats or depend on their infrastructure.
- `llama.cpp` is fully open and portable — no hidden telemetry, full offline use.

### 🚀 Max Performance (If Tuned)

- Native Metal GPU acceleration on macOS (M1/M2/M3).
- Potentially faster inference with optimized settings than pre-wrapped tools.

### 🔒 Privacy & Transparency

- No automatic analytics, model fetching, or background connections.
- Every byte of inference and config is under your control.

### 🔧 Lightweight & Flexible

- Tiny binary, minimal dependencies.
- Easily scriptable for CLI, TUI, or integration into other tools.

### 🧩 Interoperability

- Works seamlessly with other tools like:
  - LM Studio (GUI for `.gguf` models)
  - text-generation-webui (multi-backend support)
  - KoboldCPP, GPT4All, llama-cpp-python

### 🛠️ Developer & Research Friendly

- Ideal for experimenting, benchmarking, or building your own LLM tools.
- Active open-source community with rapid updates and support.
